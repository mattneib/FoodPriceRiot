libraries used:  
library(dplyr)

library(ggplot2)  

Data from the United Nations: 
[The FAO Food Price Index](http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/) is a measure of the monthly change in 
international prices of a basket of food commodities. Monthly updates.

Will need to update locations and folder names in "FoodPriceIndex.Rmd": 

>#location of files and folders:  
code_folder <- "/Users/matt/R Code" #location of R code  - not used  
input_folder <- "/Users/matt/R csvData"  #location of csv data  
output_folder <- "/Users/matt/R Output"  #where output goes  

>###############  
code_file = "FoodPrice1.R"  #not used  
input_data = "Food_Price.csv"  
###############  

Download "FoodPriceIndex.Rmd", "Food_Price.csv",   
update the locations on your computer and should run as R markdown.  
Will also make individual graphs and store them in your output_folder.

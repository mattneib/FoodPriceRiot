#food price index, 5/2018, by Matt Neibaur, analysis of food prices
#Data from the United Nations: 
#The FAO Food Price Index is a measure of the monthly change in 
#international prices of a basket of food commodities.
#Relevance: During Irish famine, food prices spiked, food available but unafordable

## The Arab Spring 

* uprising may have been triggered by increased food prices
* first protests that occurred in Tunisia on 18 December 2010
* Reference: [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring)
* Preceded by riots in Africa in 2008: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_world_food_price_crisis) 


According to [this independent news - *Food riots shut down main towns*:](http://www.irinnews.org/report/76905/burkina-faso-food-riots-shut-down-main-towns
)

>Riots over high food prices have already erupted in Burkina Fasoâ€™s Sahelian neighbours Mauritania and Senegal this year which are unusual in the region for being highly dependent on imported wheat and rice, products which have become more expensive worldwide this year. 

>In West Africa that situation is being compounded by unusually high food prices because of a disrupted growing season in some parts of the region in 2007 and reports that traders are hoarding stocks at markets in northern Nigeria, Ghana and elsewhere.
